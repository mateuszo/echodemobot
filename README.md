Do you recognize this movie? It's [War Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames) from 1983. 
WOPR is a supercomputer running artificial intelligence program that simulates Global Thermonuclear War. 
It communicates with humans using text. Thus it's perfect to demonstrate the Messenger Platform capabilities.
